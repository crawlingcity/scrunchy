### Optimization tools

The package will use these optimizers if they are present on your system:

- [cjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg)
- [jpegtran](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg)
- [Pngquant 2](https://pngquant.org/)
- [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng)
- [advpng](https://www.npmjs.com/package/advpng-bin)
- [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/precompiled)

(make sure they are globaly accessible, or deal yourself with the paths - THIS WON'T INSTALL THEM FOR YOU)
